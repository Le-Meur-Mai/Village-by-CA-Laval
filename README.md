# Village by C/A Website - Portfolio Project

We have several branches on this project, each with a different role:

- The main branch is the production branch; it's the validated version of the code from the Dev branch.
- The Dev branch is used to gather and merge the code from both developers. This allows us to identify conflicts and test the code as a whole before pushing it to the main production branch.

- The mai and guillaume branches are personal branches for code development.
